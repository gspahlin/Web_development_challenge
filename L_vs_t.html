                  <h3>Temperature Correlates with Latitude</h3>
                  <br>
                  <p>  Temperature correlates with latitude, but as you can see, the sign of the correlation is dependant on the hemisphere. This 
                    is because the warmest temperatures are always near the equator, which gets the most direct sunlight of any region of earth. This data was
                    taken in January. Because of that the correlation is stronger in the northern hemisphere, where it is winter. The fact that it is winter means
                    that the difference in direct sunlight received at the equator and the north pole is much greater than in the south.

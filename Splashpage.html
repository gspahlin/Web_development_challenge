                <h3>How Does the Weather Change as One Approaches the Poles?</h3>
                <p> It might seem obvious that as one goes north towards the arctic or south towards the antarctic, things tend to cool down. Most people have had the
                    experience of visiting a warm location to the south of them - whether it be a tropical location, or a state or city somewhat to the south. But how well 
                    does this actually hold? Should we be disturbed that warm, sunny Spain shares similar latitudes to the relatively cold Illinois? And are other weather 
                    patterns such as cloud cover or humidity related to latitude?
                </p>
                <p> In order to answer these questions I have built a program to dial 500 - 600 weather stations around the planet to obtain current weather data. The data is
                    then plotted using the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries of python. The plots and commentary can be found on the pages of this website.
